  This repository consists of different ANN methods that i have used and practiced on the churn modelling dataset.

  The code consists of the following:

1. Data cleaning and creating dummy variables
2. Data frames concatenation and feature scaling
3. using the sequential classifier to create my own ANN using relu activation function for the hidden layers and sigmoid activation functionn for the output layer (since it is a binary classification problem)
4. Training the model for upto 50 epochs and seeing the results
